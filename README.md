## Redesigning a Tweet

**Tools**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Twitter API, Bootstrap

#### Goals & Design Analysis
To encourage a different type of social behaviour as compared to what I believe the current tweet design encourages now, I have redesigned a tweet to focus on retweeting with comments instead of replying for users, and to continue emphasising the content of the tweet. 

The goal of having tweets in this manner would be to focus on fostering a community of people with similar viewpoints rather than opposing. It would allow people to feel more safe in responding to things they see on their timeline and sharing it with their followers, but rather than directly engaging with the author of the tweet, they can share their own opinion on it without bothering the original author as much. 

When a user clicks on a tweet, they will be brought to a card with a large text area for commenting above the tweet they clicked on. I kept some key details like author profile, the date and time, retweets, favourites, and source device with the author of the tweet’s location, to allow for understanding more about the context of the author in space and time. I eliminated the reply section of the tweet in the hopes of keeping things more civil and reducing the violent/harmful discourse that can sometimes happen in the replies section of a tweet. A user cannot see the number of quote-retweets they get on a particular tweet and this allows people the privacy and added comfort of replying however they want, to whichever tweet they want. 

Though I could see how this design would not allow for much communication between groups of differing opinion, I want with this redesign to prioritise the feeling of a ‘safe-space’ for those who want to foster a community of like-minded individuals.
